<h3>Some people don't belive that skincare can really help, but your just not thinking how products work for YOU</h3>
<h4>Here are some real people who used products, and saw a noticeable difference</h4>
<p>I always believed in beauty sleep; I’ve seen research suggesting that if you get the right amount of sleep every night, 
it’s sure to help your skin glow when you wake up, but it’s hard to come by with how busy I am.

Work gets in the way of most of the things I want to accomplish, including, but not limited to, paying attention to what my
 skin needs. I have a good grasp on skincare, but nothing much to brag about. I know I need to cleanse, moisturize, and maybe 
 even try on a few serums from time to time.
Since I learned those few steps, it has significantly helped my complexion, but sadly it stops there. My work requires me to
 travel a lot- so sleep is something I’m not sure I’d get when we land, as time zones are a hindrance, and jetlag is inevitable
 for me. Because of this, I can’t subscribe to a full nighttime routine as much as I’d want to. I’m only ab`out to turn 25, but
 I want to take care of my skin because it’ll be hard to catch up when the damage is done a few years down the line.

I suffer from dry skin, even though I swear to my friends I drink enough water to keep me hydrated for the rest of the day. 
It still felt like my skin needed that extra boost of moisture especially when I’m off to dreamland and do anything about it. 
I read that at night the skin is more susceptible to absorbing creams packed with antioxidants so it has been my mission to find
 even one new addition to my routine that I can squeeze.

To give my skin a boost for when sleep is scarce, I searched high and low until a friend suggested Tevenere Botanics, 
specifically their night cream. She swears by it, saying she’s never looked so dewy in her life! I think she just has a natural
 glow about her, but I’m willing to see for myself.
 The name sounded encouraging, Rejuvenating Night Cream; I looked up its key ingredients and had high hopes going into it. I think 
 I fell in love because I was far from disappointed. It blew me away! A few weeks in, my skin is soft to the touch, my cheeks are 
 lightly tinted red even without make-up on, and I look like I have the most restful night of sleep every morning when I look into 
 the mirror! Now, I carry it with me everywhere and do not go a night without it!</p>

<p>Stress has been piling up since I started at my new office job, and though I have dreamt of having the chance to prove myself 
in such a high position, I guess I have not adjusted well enough to the fast-paced life of my dreams coming true.

I have been working in a relatively small firm- up until a few months ago, the workload was light and breezy, but It felt like I 
wasn’t growing to my full potential. There was no chance to spread my wings, as they say. And though I had an easier time there 
to where I am now, I still wanted to flex my creative muscles. As difficult as it is, I now know how to handle bigger responsibilities 
and am getting the recognition I deserve.

And while I face many new challenges at work, it seems my skin, especially my face, is going through things as well. Try as I might, 
I couldn’t cover up the increasingly noticeable lines and bags under my eyes, it doesn’t help that I’m just caking on make-up and getting 
more insecure as I do so.

Don’t get me wrong, I love how I look, but there are days when I’m just tired, all the time, and don’t look and feel my best. In those 
downtimes, I try to see what treatments I can do to diminish these lines; some are all too involved for my liking. I then moved on to 
products, and one finally caught my eye.

When I opened Pearl de Flore’s website, I thought it was just a simple gifting service, but after a few more scrolling, I found out they
 also carried skincare. It gave the vibe that I should give myself a little something to get my mood up, and they had a product for exactly
 my problem!

I felt like it was a sign that I stumbled onto them- this pretty website covered in pink had the Noir Instant Wrinkle Treatment Syringe 
that worked so well it was like some sort of miracle! The wrinkles I have been dreading simply lightened to non-existence after only a few 
uses, and with each passing day, I feel myself getting back into my old, confident self!

Fine Lines and Stress
It reminded me that no matter the obstacle, I can always find a way to change it around. I’ll continue to work as hard as I can to achieve
 my goals while looking my absolute best!</p>
