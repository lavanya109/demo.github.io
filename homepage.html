<h1>Skincare</h1>
<p>Skincare can be confusing, but its simple, as soon as you understand your skin! Everyone's skin is different, so everyone uses a
different combinations of skincare products. Some people also get worried that the products get to expensive, but thats ok! You don't
need them to have good skin! You can get cheaper products, but be careful as some can be very harful to your skin.</p>
<h2>Skin Types</h2>
<p> So there are different types of skin, and that can affect what products to use and how often. Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>oily</li>
<li>dry</li>
<li>sensitive</li>
</ul>
<h2>What products to use for each skin type</h2>
<p>As we know, each skin type has different needs, so you should learn what you need depending on <strong>you</strong>.</p>
<li>For oily skin, cleanse with an exfoliating cleanser morning and night. Use a toner that contains salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or lactic acid.
Treat your skin with benzoyl peroxide or retinol. Moisturize morning and night with a lightweight moisturizer.</lii>
<li> For dry skin, cleanse with a hydrating cleanser that doesnâ€™t disrupt the outer skin layer. Tone with an alcohol-free toner to restore skin pH.
Target specific skin concerns with a serum. Moisturize with a nourishing, noncomedogenic moisturizer to lock in hydration.
Protect from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays to prevent sun damage.</li>
<li>For sensitive skin, all that can be said is too use hyperallergenic products, and look at the indredients of everything you buy, even if you have have 
bought it multiple times.
</ul>
<p>In skincare there are lots of products, so here are the pros and cons of some of them</p>
